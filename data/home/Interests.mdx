My research interests span cognitive modeling, bio-inspired AI, and educational neuroscience. I am particularly interested in how computational models can be used to understand cognitive processes and enhance educational outcomes. Through my work, I aim to advance our understanding of cognitive processes and apply this knowledge to create more effective and personalized educational environments.
