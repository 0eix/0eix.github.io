Recent graduate in cognitive science with a strong foundation in software engineering. I am seeking opportunities to contribute to research and development in cognitive modeling and educational cognitive neuroscience. My interests include adaptive learning systems for neurodiverse students (particularly ASD and ADHD), neurocognitive mechanisms in educational contexts, cognitive modeling and simulation for intervention design, educational technology for accessibility, and advancing open science and reproducibility in cognitive modeling.
