I am currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Cognitive Science at Grenoble Institute of Technology (Grenoble INP, UGA). Previously, I earned an M.Sc. in Computer Science from Cheikh Anta Diop University in Dakar, Senegal, and a B.Sc. in Computer Science applied to Management from Groupe ISM in Dakar. Beyond academia, I have professional experience as a software engineer and consultant, providing tailored software solutions to clients in Togo and Senegal.
